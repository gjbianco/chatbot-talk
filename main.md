# chatbots and you
--
# what do we mean by _chatbot_?
--
# connects to your chat platform
## e.g. slack
--
# mostly acts like another user
## except for the whole being a bot thing
--
# being a bot means they are <br> 🎊 _programmable_ 🎊
--
# programming one is pretty easy
--
# we'll focus on *Hubot* chatbots
--
# Hubot is a chatbot framework by GitHub
--
# largely written in <br> ☕️ CoffeeScript ☕️
## this is changing!
--
# you can write your scripts in CoffeeScript _or_ JavaScript
## or both
--
# we'll use <br> 🚀 JavaScript 🚀
## because I don't like CoffeeScript...
--
# install Node.js <br> https://nodejs.org/en/download/
--
# we'll use a seed project
## https://github.com/gjbianco/chatbot-talk
--
# official getting started guide: <br> https://hubot.github.com/docs/
## we won't be using this
--
# fork and clone the repository
## or just download the zip, but that's not as cool
--
